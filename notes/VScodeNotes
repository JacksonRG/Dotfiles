ctrl-j hides and shows the terminal window.

ctrl-p opens palette

use ctrl-p to access other shortucts even in vim mode.

so changing colorscheme, or navigating to terminal window
just prefix shortcut with ctrl-p

ALSO use this to go zen mode ! 'ctrl-k z' doesnt work without palette
prefix

set ctrl - p 'when' clause to '!terminalFocus'
